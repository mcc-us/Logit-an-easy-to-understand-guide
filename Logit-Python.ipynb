    "# Using Logistic Regression for Binary Classification: An Easy-To-Understand Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "by Matthew Curcio\n",
    "\n",
    "For individuals who have studied cell biology or biochemistry, logistic regression may be familiar as [dose-response curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose%E2%80%93response_relationship) in clinical testing, the sigmoidal curve of [Oxgen binding to Haemoglobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_equation_(biochemistry)), [median lethal dose curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) drug safety or even an [exponential growth given limited resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function).\n",
    "\n",
    "When Data Scientists discuss Logistic Regression (Logit) it is often used as a binary classifier. But, It can help you understand an outcome or make a prediction by providing three useful pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Presence or Absence of a substance or quality\n",
    "2. Probability of an event\n",
    "3. Odds for or against an event\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English, a classifier is used to define or predict **Yes:No** answers, **Success:Failure** or even **Fraud:Safe**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, Logit can help answer many questions like, \n",
    "\n",
    ">Are customers going to leave my business?   \n",
    ">Is this transaction *Fraud or Safe*?   \n",
    ">What is the probability that an event may occur?   \n",
    ">What are the odds of being diagnosed with cancer if you smoke versus if you do not? \n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "It can even help Data Scientists determine which factors are important for keeping your customers and the probability of an event occurring.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take an example. A graphic of the world population over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![World Population between 1950-2100](assets/world-pop-1950-2100.cc.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the projected world population, we see each continent is added like a stacked bar chart but now over time. Further back in time, we approach a 0 zero population of humans. In the future, we will find a maximum value, an asymptote, that will be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let’s see if we can simplify this complicated s-shaped curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we only consider any two points on our curve, we can describe it like a line or a linear set of equations.\n",
    "This would make sense since each continent has its own growth rate per time (β continent) and initial starting population (X continent) at t=0 plus some constant.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Population(t=0 → t) = βAsia.XAsia + βAfrica.XAfrica +...+ βOceania.XOceania + β0\n",

    "If we look at EQ1 and figure 1, we see multiplication in matrix format. A (1 row by 6 column) matrix times a (1 column by 6 row) matrix + b = Y, our population at time = t.\n",

    "\n",
    "Population(t=0 → t) = MX + b\n",
